# Bonus Material

I have included some bonus material along with this book. Although I believe that I have done a reasonable job of writing and introduction to text editing
in Emacs, there is far more to it than simply editing text. Many of you reading this book will have come from other text editors such as Vim (like I did) and will just need 
the quickstart to get up and running with Emacs.

In the following sections, you will find exactly that as well as several other guides and tips to help you get the most out of your experience with Emacs.
