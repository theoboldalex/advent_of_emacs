# Advent of Emacs

This is a book about Emacs. As a long time (neo)vim user, I have long been curious as to what happens on the other side of the battlements in the church of Emacs.
At the start of 2024 I dipped my toes into this world on and off as I was working with Clojure and had heard about the great support Emacs offered for the language through Cider.

I was surprised by just how much I liked Emacs and found the learning curve to be at least as challenging as Vim's although in a different way. While I have not fully switched over to Emacs for my work,
I do enjoy using it on personal projects and even wrote this book in Emacs.

I hope there is something to learn from the tips shared in this book whether you are brand new to Emacs or whether you have been using it for a while.
